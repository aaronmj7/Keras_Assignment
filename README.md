# Keras_Assignment

In this assignment you will be building a script to classify images of animals. The assignment is broken up into sections and you need to complete each section successively. The sections are:
1. Data Processing - You will need to write a small image processing function and then utilise the tensorflow tf.data API to build an efficient and optimised data processing pipeline.
2. Model Definition - Given a predefined model summary, you need to construct and compile a convolutional neural network. You will need to discern the correct layer settings from the model summary by inspecting the output shapes and number of parameters in each layer.
3. Model Training - You will define a set of callbacks to log the model process, and then train it for a given number of epochs.
4. Model Evaluation - You will inspect and analyse the models performance by creating plots and discussing them with a critical eye in a 1-2 page written report.

In addition to this coding exercise, you must write a 1-2 page report analysing and critically evaluating your model's results. Marks for the report will be awarded for depth of analysis and critical thinking skills. You should consider how well your model performs and WHY it does thatâ€”give specific examples and comment on their importance.
